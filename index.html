    <p>With a GitHub Enterprise account, 
        you can restrict access to your 
        GitHub Pages site by publishing it
         privately. A privately published
          site can only be accessed by 
          people with read access to the 
          repository the site is published 
          from. You can use privately 
          published sites to share your 
          internal documentation or 
          knowledge base with members of 
          your enterprise.</p>
